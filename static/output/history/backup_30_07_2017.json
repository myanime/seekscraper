These hours all fall within our normal hours of operation, and therefore the standard casual hourly wage rate applies.

Our clinic is complex due to the variety of treatment modalities, clinical testing and health programs we offer.  There is a lot to learn and a lot to remember and you will need to be able to catch on quickly.\nThere may be an opportunity in the future to learn clinical testing tasks and operate scanning equipment.\n  Our Culture\nWe have a strong and supportive team culture and particularly value honesty, integrity and gentle confidence. \nWe aim to create a welcoming, relaxing atmosphere for both staff and clients, and we rely on our team members to help nurture this kind of environment.\n\nIf you believe this role is for you, please show me why in an email to employees@naturalpainsolutions.com.au before 9pm on SATURDAY 5TH AUGUST 2017.\nINTERVIEWS WILL BE HELD ON MONDAY AUGUST 7TH.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT CALL THE CLINIC - our staff are extremely busy dealing with clients and do not have time to take your call.
